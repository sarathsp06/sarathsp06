### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sarath. I'm a backend developer,and I mostly work with Web Backend Services and fault tolerant distributed systems. I care deeply about building interfaces that are releable and writing code that is readable. 

 My professional life has been 100% driven by my passion for problem soloving and getting to see things that build in action. I loved to play with DS/Algo and computational geometry in school. Started my career working with COBOL and i found myself interested in learning new languages and startups. I got my hand dirty with android devlopemnt , web ui , backend services using languages ranging from Java, JS, Python , PHP to Go and now mostly spend time with backed services using Golang

Right now, Iâ€™m excited about Coding pracises, Golang and much promising Rust + WebAssembly.
    
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on tools built with golang or rust
